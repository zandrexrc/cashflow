## Notes
- You might get a warning from your anti-virus software when installing the app for the first time. 
Why? Because the app is improperly signed (code signing certificates aren't really cheap :/ ). 
Nevertheless, please be assured that the app is safe and does not contain any malware.
- If the installer is not working, or if you just don't want installing unknown programs, you can download the 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vwnvy800zf1sezp/cashflow-win-unpacked.zip?dl=1">unpacked .exe app</a> that requires no installation.
