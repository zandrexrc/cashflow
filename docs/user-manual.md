### Additional notes
- The next billing date of the subscription is anchored based on the first 
billing date and the billing cycle. For example, if the first billing date is 
March 30 and the cycle is monthly, the next billing date will be April 30.   
If the next billing date falls beyond the scope of the month (e.g. there is no 
April 31), the date will be set on the last day of the month instead (April 30).
- Unlike transactions, the account balance will __not__ be automatically 
updated whenever a subscription approaches its billing date. You will have to 
create a transaction upon successful payment of a subscription to register it 
in the system.
